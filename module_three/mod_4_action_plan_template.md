# Template: Module 4 Action Plan 
*This is your deliverable from the [Job Search Strategies I session](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/job_search_strategies_i.md)*

## Module 4 Goals
*List your longterm goal(s) of what you want to accomplish by the end of module 4*

By the end of Mod 4, I'd like to have started viable application processes to at least 4 companies (viable = progressing through interviews)

### Strategy To Achieve Goals:
In this section, break down your longterm goal into smaller goals that you want to work on each week and/or day

#### Coding (both including your module 4 curriculum and anything outside of it):
*How will you focus your learning to accomplish your longterm goal?*

Approach Javascript with energy and enthusiasm. Pick up more strategies to help become increasingly comfortable approaching new tools

#### Opportunities Research:
*How will you continue researching companies and contacts? How will you utilize your Trello Board?* 

Continue asking friends, colleagues, and family for introductions and then follow up on them. Look up contacts at the consultancies I've researched and reach out for coffee. Use Trello to keep notes. Learn how to pass along my resume gracefully.

#### Cold Outreach/Network:
*Who will you reach out to? Have you considered talking with alumni about their own networking practices when they started their job search?

I've started a list of promising-looking consultancies in the Denver area and plan on reaching out to them. I also plan on taking advantage of whatever advice and help Turing is willing to offer students.

#### Personal Branding *(A personal branding section is optional)*:
*How might personal branding pieces help you towards your goal?*

### Timeline:
*What will you do when?*

Be committed and consistent about leaving time for networking. Every Tuesday and Friday afternoon -- leave open for meetings. Wednesday mornings, research and outreach

#### Module Tasks:
*What will you do throughout the module?*
Every Tuesday and Friday afternoon -- leave open for meetings. Wednesday mornings, research and outreach

#### Weekly Tasks:
*What will you do throughout each week?*

Every Tuesday and Friday afternoon -- leave open for meetings. Wednesday mornings, research and outreach

## What I Will Work on with Meg
*What advice do you need? What would be helpful to talk through? Let Meg know here!*

I need to know what to do during coffee to turn a nice conversation into a possible job. I'm not sure how to ask someone to pass along my resume without it making it seem like the whole reason I wanted to speak to the person was to ask for a job.
