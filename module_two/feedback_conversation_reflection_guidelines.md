# Feedback II Reflection

* Date of feedback conversation: 5/10/17

* How did you prepare for the conversation? 
  
  - Thinking of ways we can create more efficiencies, overcome some of the extra challenges presented to our group because we're half the size of other groups. Also thinking of how we'll need to be conscious of things we're not learning because of our group size. 

* How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult? 

  - My partner and I have had really strong communication throughout the project, so I think that we're both comfortable giving and receiving feedback. It's always a concern when commenting on someone else's skills or performance that they'll take it more harshly than was intended. But, this conversation went well.

* What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?

  - We actively listened, explained intent, talked until resolution, discussed plans for future implementation.
  
* Any other comments:
